  "faq.a1": "OffMeta is a natural language search tool for Magic: The Gathering cards. Instead of learning complex Scryfall syntax, you can describe what you're looking for in plain English and OffMeta translates it into a valid search query.",
  "faq.q2": "How does natural language MTG card search work?",
  "faq.a2": "OffMeta uses AI to understand your search intent and converts it into Scryfall search syntax. For example, typing 'cheap green ramp spells' becomes a proper query filtering by color, card type, mana cost, and oracle text for mana-producing effects.",
  "faq.q3": "Is OffMeta free to use?",
  "faq.a3": "Yes, OffMeta is completely free to use. There are no accounts required, no subscriptions, and no limits on searches.",
  "faq.q4": "Where does OffMeta get its card data?",
  "faq.a4": "OffMeta uses the Scryfall API as its data source. Scryfall maintains a comprehensive, up-to-date database of all Magic: The Gathering cards including oracle text, prices, legalities, and card images.",
  "faq.q5": "Can I use OffMeta to search for Commander/EDH cards?",
  "faq.a5": "Yes! You can search for cards legal in any format including Commander, Standard, Modern, Legacy, and more. Simply mention the format in your search like 'commander legal board wipes under $5' or use the format filter chips.",
  "faq.q6": "Can I search in my own language?",
  "faq.a6": "Yes! OffMeta supports searching in 11 languages including English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, Russian, and Chinese. Just type your search in your preferred language — OffMeta automatically detects and translates it before generating the Scryfall query.",

  "guide.intro.search-by-creature-type": "The simplest search you can do on OffMeta is typing a creature type. Want Dragons? Type \"dragons.\" Looking for Elves? Type \"elves.\" OffMeta understands plural forms, common nicknames, and tribal slang, so no special syntax is needed. If you're new to MTG card search, start here.",
  "guide.howHelps.search-by-creature-type": "When you type \"dragons,\" OffMeta recognizes it as a creature type search and converts your plain English into Scryfall's type filter syntax (t:dragon), handling the plural-to-singular conversion. You don't need to know that Scryfall uses \"t:\" for type searches. OffMeta figures that out for you.",
  "guide.tip1.search-by-creature-type": "You can type the plural (\"goblins\") or singular (\"goblin\"). Both work.",
  "guide.tip2.search-by-creature-type": "Try less common types too: Changelings, Slivers, Treefolk, Faeries.",
  "guide.tip3.search-by-creature-type": "Combine with other words naturally: \"legendary dragons\" finds legendary dragon creatures.",
  "guide.tip4.search-by-creature-type": "OffMeta knows MTG slang: \"changelings\" maps to the Changeling type.",
  "guide.faq1q.search-by-creature-type": "What creature types does OffMeta recognize?",
  "guide.faq1a.search-by-creature-type": "OffMeta recognizes all official MTG creature types, over 270 of them. From common ones like Human, Elf, and Dragon to obscure ones like Brushwagg, Beeble, and Azra.",
  "guide.faq2q.search-by-creature-type": "Can I search for non-creature types?",
  "guide.faq2a.search-by-creature-type": "Yes. Try \"equipment,\" \"auras,\" \"planeswalkers,\" or \"enchantments.\" OffMeta handles all card types, not just creatures.",

  "guide.intro.filter-by-color": "Color is fundamental to Magic deckbuilding. OffMeta lets you filter by color using everyday language. Say \"red creatures,\" \"mono blue spells,\" or even guild names like \"Simic\" or \"Rakdos.\" You can also specify color identity for Commander, where it matters most.",
  "guide.howHelps.filter-by-color": "OffMeta interprets \"mono red\" as a color identity constraint (id=r), not just color. This matters because color identity determines what cards you can play in Commander. It also maps \"creatures\" to the type filter (t:creature) and combines them. Guild names like \"Dimir\" are mapped to their color pairs (U+B) automatically.",
  "guide.tip1.filter-by-color": "Use guild names for two-color combos: Azorius (W/U), Dimir (U/B), Rakdos (B/R), Gruul (R/G), Selesnya (G/W).",
  "guide.tip2.filter-by-color": "Use shard/wedge names for three colors: Esper, Grixis, Jund, Naya, Bant, Abzan, Jeskai, Sultai, Mardu, Temur.",
  "guide.tip3.filter-by-color": "\"Colorless\" works too. Try \"colorless artifacts\" to find cards with no color identity.",
  "guide.tip4.filter-by-color": "Saying \"mono green\" restricts to ONLY green, while \"green\" allows multicolor cards containing green.",
  "guide.faq1q.filter-by-color": "What is the difference between color and color identity?",
  "guide.faq1a.filter-by-color": "Color is what appears in the mana cost. Color identity includes the mana cost PLUS any mana symbols in the rules text. In Commander, you can only include cards whose color identity is within your commander's color identity.",
  "guide.faq2q.filter-by-color": "How do I search for exactly two colors?",
  "guide.faq2a.filter-by-color": "Use the guild name: \"Izzet creatures\" finds creatures that are exactly blue and red. Or say \"blue red creatures\" and OffMeta will figure out the correct identity filter.",

  "guide.intro.budget-price-filters": "Building on a budget? OffMeta understands price-related language like \"cheap,\" \"budget,\" \"under $5,\" and \"affordable.\" You can combine price filters with any other search to find what you need without overspending. Commander players especially use this one a lot.",
  "guide.howHelps.budget-price-filters": "OffMeta understands \"budget\" and \"under $5\" both refer to price and picks the more specific one ($5). It translates \"board wipes\" into Scryfall's tag system (otag:boardwipe), which is more accurate than searching oracle text. Then it applies the price filter (usd<5).",
  "guide.tip1.budget-price-filters": "\"Cheap\" defaults to under $1, \"budget\" to under $5, but you can say \"under $3\" for any custom threshold.",
  "guide.tip2.budget-price-filters": "Price filters use current TCGplayer market prices via Scryfall.",
  "guide.tip3.budget-price-filters": "Try \"expensive mythics over $50\" to browse the high end too.",
  "guide.tip4.budget-price-filters": "Combine with format: \"budget commander staples under $3\" is a very popular search.",
  "guide.faq1q.budget-price-filters": "How current are the prices?",
  "guide.faq1a.budget-price-filters": "Scryfall updates prices daily from TCGplayer. Prices reflect the most recent market data available, though they may lag actual prices by a few hours.",
  "guide.faq2q.budget-price-filters": "Can I search in other currencies?",
  "guide.faq2a.budget-price-filters": "Currently OffMeta uses USD pricing from Scryfall. Euro pricing (eur<) is available via Scryfall syntax, which you can use in the editable query bar.",

  "guide.intro.format-legality-search": "Different formats have different card pools. OffMeta understands format names and legality constraints. Just mention the format in your search and it gets applied automatically. Say \"pauper legal removal\" or \"modern counterspells\" and OffMeta filters to only cards legal in that format.",
  "guide.howHelps.format-legality-search": "OffMeta recognizes \"commander\" as a format, even if you say \"EDH\" or \"CMDR\" instead. It applies the format legality filter (f:commander) and combines it with the price constraint. The word \"staples\" signals high-utility cards, which OffMeta can sort by EDHREC rank for the most relevant results.",
  "guide.tip1.format-legality-search": "OffMeta knows format aliases: \"EDH\" = \"CMDR\" = \"Commander,\" \"T2\" = \"Standard.\"",
  "guide.tip2.format-legality-search": "Combine formats with anything: \"pauper legal draw spells,\" \"modern-legal fetchlands.\"",
  "guide.tip3.format-legality-search": "For Commander, color identity matters more than color. OffMeta handles this automatically.",
  "guide.tip4.format-legality-search": "Try \"standard legal mythics\" or \"pioneer legal planeswalkers\" for format-specific browsing.",
  "guide.faq1q.format-legality-search": "Which formats does OffMeta support?",
  "guide.faq1a.format-legality-search": "All formats Scryfall tracks: Standard, Pioneer, Modern, Legacy, Vintage, Pauper, Commander, Brawl, Historic, Alchemy, Explorer, and more. Just mention the format name.",
  "guide.faq2q.format-legality-search": "Can I search for banned cards?",
  "guide.faq2a.format-legality-search": "Yes. Try \"banned in commander\" or \"banned in modern\" to see cards that are banned in specific formats.",

  "guide.intro.keyword-ability-search": "Magic has over 100 keyword abilities, from evergreen staples like Flying and Haste to set-specific mechanics like Connive and Offspring. OffMeta maps these to Scryfall's dedicated keyword operator for precise results, which is much better than searching oracle text (that often produces false positives).",
  "guide.howHelps.keyword-ability-search": "Instead of searching oracle text for the word \"flying\" (which would also match \"flying carpet\" or references to flight), OffMeta uses Scryfall's kw: operator. This targets the actual keyword abilities a card has. It also knows that \"deathtouch\" and \"flying\" are separate keywords and applies them as AND filters.",
  "guide.tip1.keyword-ability-search": "OffMeta knows 80+ keyword abilities: haste, trample, lifelink, vigilance, menace, flash, hexproof, and many more.",
  "guide.tip2.keyword-ability-search": "Combine keywords: \"creatures with haste and trample\" finds creatures that have both.",
  "guide.tip3.keyword-ability-search": "Some keywords need oracle text search: \"goad\" and \"annihilator\" use o: instead of kw: for accuracy.",
  "guide.tip4.keyword-ability-search": "Try \"evasion creatures\" as a shortcut. OffMeta expands it to flying, menace, skulk, shadow, and more.",
  "guide.faq1q.keyword-ability-search": "What is the difference between kw: and searching oracle text?",
  "guide.faq1a.keyword-ability-search": "The kw: operator checks a card's actual keyword abilities, not just text. Searching oracle text for \"flying\" might match cards that mention flying but don't have it. kw:flying only returns cards that actually have flying.",
  "guide.faq2q.keyword-ability-search": "Can I search for cards that GRANT keywords to others?",
  "guide.faq2a.keyword-ability-search": "Yes. Try \"cards that give haste\" or \"haste enablers.\" OffMeta searches for oracle text that grants the ability to other creatures.",

  "guide.intro.ramp-and-card-draw": "Instead of guessing what oracle text to search, you can describe card functions: \"ramp spells,\" \"mana dorks,\" \"card draw,\" \"cantrips.\" OffMeta understands these gameplay concepts and translates them into the right combination of type, tag, and oracle text filters.",
  "guide.howHelps.ramp-and-card-draw": "OffMeta breaks down your intent: \"green\" becomes a color filter, \"ramp spells\" maps to Scryfall's curated mana-ramp tag, and \"search for lands\" becomes oracle text for library searching. It uses Scryfall's otag: system (community-curated functional tags) when available, which tends to be more accurate than raw text search.",
  "guide.tip1.ramp-and-card-draw": "MTG slang works: \"rocks\" = mana artifacts, \"dorks\" = mana creatures, \"cantrips\" = cheap draw spells.",
  "guide.tip2.ramp-and-card-draw": "Try functional searches: \"sacrifice outlets,\" \"tutor effects,\" \"reanimation spells.\"",
  "guide.tip3.ramp-and-card-draw": "OffMeta uses Scryfall's tag system for functions like ramp, draw, and removal. These are community-curated and very accurate.",
  "guide.tip4.ramp-and-card-draw": "Combine function + constraint: \"cheap card draw in mono black under $2.\"",
  "guide.faq1q.ramp-and-card-draw": "What is the difference between \"ramp\" and \"mana rocks\"?",
  "guide.faq1a.ramp-and-card-draw": "\"Ramp\" broadly means any mana acceleration. \"Mana rocks\" specifically means artifacts that produce mana (Sol Ring, Arcane Signet). \"Mana dorks\" are creatures that tap for mana (Llanowar Elves). OffMeta translates each correctly.",
  "guide.faq2q.ramp-and-card-draw": "How does OffMeta know what \"card draw\" means?",
  "guide.faq2a.ramp-and-card-draw": "OffMeta maps strategy concepts to Scryfall tags and oracle text patterns. \"Card draw\" uses oracle text search for \"draw\" + \"card,\" while specific terms like \"cantrip\" or \"wheel\" use their own curated mappings.",

  "guide.intro.tribal-synergies-for-commander": "Tribal decks are a Commander favorite, but finding the right synergy pieces can be tricky. OffMeta lets you search for tribal payoffs by combining creature types, format legality, and functional descriptions. Go beyond just finding Elves: find Elf lords, Elf token generators, and cards that care about Elf tribal.",
  "guide.howHelps.tribal-synergies-for-commander": "OffMeta understands \"tribal payoffs\" as cards that reward you for playing a specific type. For \"elf tribal payoffs,\" it searches for cards that reference Elves in their rules text combined with typical tribal payoff patterns like \"you control\" or buff effects. Adding \"for commander\" applies the format filter.",
  "guide.tip1.tribal-synergies-for-commander": "Try \"[type] lords\" to find creatures that buff others of the same type.",
  "guide.tip2.tribal-synergies-for-commander": "Search \"cards that care about [type]\" for tribal synergy pieces that aren't necessarily that type themselves.",
  "guide.tip3.tribal-synergies-for-commander": "Combine tribal + function: \"goblin sacrifice outlets\" or \"zombie reanimation.\"",
  "guide.tip4.tribal-synergies-for-commander": "Use \"changeling\" to find creatures that count as every type. Great tribal fillers.",
  "guide.faq1q.tribal-synergies-for-commander": "What is a \"lord\" in MTG?",
  "guide.faq1a.tribal-synergies-for-commander": "A lord is a creature that gives +1/+1 or other bonuses to all creatures of a certain type. Classic examples: Elvish Archdruid for Elves, Lord of the Undead for Zombies, Goblin Chieftain for Goblins.",
  "guide.faq2q.tribal-synergies-for-commander": "Can I find cards that work with multiple tribes?",
  "guide.faq2a.tribal-synergies-for-commander": "Yes. Try \"cards that work with any creature type\" or search for Changelings, which have every creature type. You can also search for \"choose a creature type\" effects.",

  "guide.intro.token-and-sacrifice-synergies": "Aristocrats-style decks are among the most popular archetypes in Commander. They combine token generation, free sacrifice outlets, and death triggers for powerful synergy engines. OffMeta understands the full vocabulary of this archetype, from \"sac outlets\" to \"blood artist effects\" to \"death triggers.\"",
  "guide.howHelps.token-and-sacrifice-synergies": "This is a descriptive query that would be hard to write in manual syntax. OffMeta breaks it down: \"creatures\" becomes a type filter, \"make token creatures\" becomes oracle text for token creation, and \"when an opponent takes an action\" becomes opponent-triggered abilities. It assembles these into a multi-clause oracle text search.",
  "guide.tip1.token-and-sacrifice-synergies": "\"Sac outlets\" or \"sacrifice outlets\" finds cards with free sacrifice abilities.",
  "guide.tip2.token-and-sacrifice-synergies": "\"Blood artist effects\" or \"drain on death\" finds the Aristocrats payoff cards.",
  "guide.tip3.token-and-sacrifice-synergies": "\"Grave Pact effects\" finds forced sacrifice triggers.",
  "guide.tip4.token-and-sacrifice-synergies": "Combine archetype + color: \"Rakdos sacrifice outlets\" or \"Orzhov aristocrats.\"",
  "guide.faq1q.token-and-sacrifice-synergies": "What is an Aristocrats deck?",
  "guide.faq1a.token-and-sacrifice-synergies": "An Aristocrats deck sacrifices its own creatures for value. The core pieces are: token generators for fuel, free sacrifice outlets, and death trigger payoffs like Blood Artist that drain opponents when creatures die.",
  "guide.faq2q.token-and-sacrifice-synergies": "What are the best colors for sacrifice strategies?",
  "guide.faq2a.token-and-sacrifice-synergies": "Black is essential for death triggers and drain effects. Red adds token generation and Goblin Bombardment effects. White has some powerful pieces too (Teysa Karlov, Elenda). Rakdos (B/R) and Mardu (W/B/R) are the most common Aristocrats color combos.",

  "guide.intro.etb-and-flicker-combos": "ETB (enter-the-battlefield) effects are the backbone of many combo decks. Pair them with flicker/blink effects to re-trigger them over and over, or use ETB doublers like Panharmonicon to multiply the value. OffMeta understands all of this vocabulary: \"ETB,\" \"blink,\" \"flicker,\" \"enters effects.\"",
  "guide.howHelps.etb-and-flicker-combos": "\"ETB effects\" is translated to \"enters the battlefield\" oracle text. \"Double\" is mapped to the Scryfall phrasing \"triggers an additional time,\" not the word \"double\" or \"twice\" which would give wrong results. This kind of mapping is why OffMeta works better than a simple text search.",
  "guide.tip1.etb-and-flicker-combos": "\"ETB creatures\" finds creatures with enter-the-battlefield triggers.",
  "guide.tip2.etb-and-flicker-combos": "\"Flicker effects\" or \"blink effects\" finds exile-and-return cards.",
  "guide.tip3.etb-and-flicker-combos": "\"Panharmonicon effects\" or \"double ETB\" finds ETB doublers.",
  "guide.tip4.etb-and-flicker-combos": "Try \"ETB creatures in Azorius\" for the classic white-blue flicker shell.",
  "guide.faq1q.etb-and-flicker-combos": "What is the difference between \"blink\" and \"flicker\"?",
  "guide.faq1a.etb-and-flicker-combos": "They're the same thing: exiling a permanent and returning it to the battlefield to re-trigger ETB effects. \"Blink\" usually refers to instant-speed effects (like Ephemerate), while \"flicker\" is sometimes used for sorcery-speed or delayed returns.",
  "guide.faq2q.etb-and-flicker-combos": "What are the best ETB doublers?",
  "guide.faq2a.etb-and-flicker-combos": "Panharmonicon (artifacts/creatures ETB), Yarok the Desecrated (all permanents ETB), Elesh Norn, Mother of Machines (your permanents ETB), and Virtue of Loyalty. Search \"double ETB effects\" on OffMeta to find them all.",

  "guide.intro.multi-constraint-complex-search": "You can describe exactly what you need in a single sentence, combining color identity, card type, format legality, price, function, and more. \"Utility lands for commander in Esper under $5\" or \"Vampires with death triggers in white and black that cost 3 or less.\" OffMeta handles them all.",
  "guide.howHelps.multi-constraint-complex-search": "This query has FIVE distinct constraints, and OffMeta handles each one: \"utility lands\" becomes non-basic lands (t:land -t:basic), \"for commander\" becomes format legality (f:commander), \"in Esper\" becomes color identity within white-blue-black (id<=wub), and \"under $5\" becomes a price filter (usd<5). The word \"utility\" is interpreted as non-basic, because basic lands aren't \"utility.\"",
