  "faq.heading": "Frequently Asked Questions",
  "faq.q1": "What is OffMeta?",
  "faq.a1": "OffMeta is a natural language search tool for Magic: The Gathering cards. Instead of learning complex Scryfall syntax, you can describe what you're looking for in plain English and OffMeta translates it into a valid search query.",
  "faq.q2": "How does natural language MTG card search work?",
  "faq.a2": "OffMeta uses AI to understand your search intent and converts it into Scryfall search syntax. For example, typing 'cheap green ramp spells' becomes a proper query filtering by color, card type, mana cost, and oracle text for mana-producing effects.",
  "faq.q3": "Is OffMeta free to use?",
  "faq.a3": "Yes, OffMeta is completely free to use. There are no accounts required, no subscriptions, and no limits on searches.",
  "faq.q4": "Where does OffMeta get its card data?",
  "faq.a4": "OffMeta uses the Scryfall API as its data source. Scryfall maintains a comprehensive, up-to-date database of all Magic: The Gathering cards including oracle text, prices, legalities, and card images.",
  "faq.q5": "Can I use OffMeta to search for Commander/EDH cards?",
  "faq.a5": "Yes! You can search for cards legal in any format including Commander, Standard, Modern, Legacy, and more. Simply mention the format in your search like 'commander legal board wipes under $5' or use the format filter chips."
