# Trademark and Branding

"OffMeta" and the OffMeta logo are trademarks of the project owner.

You are welcome to fork, modify, and self-host the code under the AGPL-3.0 license, but:

- Forks may not present themselves as the official OffMeta service.
- Public deployments must use different branding, names, and logos.

These restrictions apply only to branding and trademarks, not to the code or license terms.
