# FAQ

## Why did my query return too many results?
- The AI translator may fall back to a broad query if it can't map all terms.
- Try adding more specific constraints (color, type, mana value).

## Why is the translation incorrect?
- The deterministic rules are intentionally conservative.
- Use the "Report search issue" dialog to provide corrections.

## Can I force Scryfall syntax?
Yes. Edit the compiled query bar and re-run the search.

## Why does it exclude lands when I search for mana production?
To avoid overly broad results, land results are excluded unless you explicitly ask for lands.
