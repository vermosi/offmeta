# Style Guide

## TypeScript & React
- Prefer functional components and hooks.
- Keep props typed and exported interfaces colocated with components.
- Avoid `any`; use `unknown` + narrowing when needed.

## Formatting
- Use Prettier for all supported file types.
- Two-space indentation is enforced by Prettier defaults.

## Testing
- Keep tests table-driven when possible.
- Use descriptive test titles that mirror user queries.

## Documentation
- Update README and `/docs` whenever behavior or scripts change.
