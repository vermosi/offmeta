## 🚀 Quickstart

**Requires:** Node.js 20.11+ (see `.nvmrc`)

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

---

## 📊 Built for Production

OffMeta includes enterprise-grade features:

- **Security**: 300+ security tests covering input sanitization, injection prevention, and rate limiting
- **E2E Coverage**: 23 Playwright scenarios across search, navigation, deck workflows, and regression-critical user paths
- **Accessibility Coverage**: Dedicated axe-core Playwright suite for critical pages and interactive flows
- **Rate Limiting**: Server and client-side throttling with abuse prevention
- **CORS Protection**: Origin allowlist enforcement with proper security headers
- **Error Sanitization**: Prevents leaking file paths, stack traces, and credentials
- **Offline-First PWA**: Service worker with intelligent caching strategies

Run security tests:

```bash
npm run test -- src/lib/security
# Optional equivalent: bun run test -- src/lib/security
```

Run E2E and accessibility tests:

```bash
npx playwright test --project=chromium
npx playwright test --grep @a11y
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

| Variable                        | Required | Description                   |
| ------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------- |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`             | Yes      | Supabase project URL          |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Yes      | Supabase anon/publishable key |

For Edge Function environment variables, see [`docs/configuration.md`](docs/configuration.md).

---

## 🏗️ How It Works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  UI["UI (text/voice)"] --> Edge["Supabase Edge Function"]
  Edge --> Translate["Deterministic translation"]
  Translate -->|fallback| AI["AI interpretation"]
  Translate --> Scryfall["Scryfall API"]
  AI --> Scryfall
  Scryfall --> Results["Results + metadata"]
  Results --> UI
  UI --> Cache["Client cache"]
```

1. You enter a natural-language query (text or voice)
2. The frontend sends the request to a Supabase Edge Function
3. The Edge Function deterministically translates the prompt to Scryfall syntax (AI is fallback only)
4. Results are fetched from Scryfall API, cached, and rendered

For architecture details, see [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).

## 🎯 Example Queries

Try these searches:

- `"artifact that produces 2 mana and costs four or less"`
- `"red or black creature that costs at least 5 mana and draws cards"`
- `"equipment which costs 3 and equips for 2"`
- `"green cards that let you sacrifice lands"`
- `"cards with cows in the art"`
- `"commanders with more than one color, one of which is blue"`
